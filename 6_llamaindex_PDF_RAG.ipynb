The RVS faint completeness limit is hence\\nnot sharp either. In addition, the onboard software (Sect. 3.3.8)\\nadapts the RVS threshold, through user-conﬁgurable look-up\\ntables, to the instantaneous, straylight-dominated background\\nlevel (Sect. 4.2), which means in practice that the faint limit\\nvaries between ∼15.5 and ∼16.2 mag over a spin period. At\\nthe end of the mission, however, taking the evolving scanning\\nlaw into account (Sect. 5.2), the e ﬀective faint limit will still be\\nGRVS ≈16.2 mag (or even a bit fainter, taking onboard RP ﬂux-\\nmeasurement errors into account).\\n9.

With a focal plane containing more than 100\\nCCD detectors, Gaia surveys the heavens and repeatedly ob-\\nserves all objects down to G ≈ 20.7 mag during its ﬁve-year\\nnominal lifetime.

Another paper talks about differential abundances and tidal tails of open clusters.\n",
